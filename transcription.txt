Like a small boat on the ocean Sending big waves into motion  Like how a single word can make a heart open I might only have one match, but I can make an explosion  And all those things I didn't say Were wrecking balls inside my brain  I will scream out loud tonight. Can you hear my voice this time?. This is my fight song Take back my light song  Prove that I'm alright song. My power's turned on I'll start it right now  I'll be strong I'll play my fight song. And I don't really care if nobody else believes  Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me. Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep. Everybody's worried about me  In too deep, say I'm in too deep. It's been two years, I've missed my home. But there's fire burning in my bones I still believe,. yeah. I still believe. And all those things I didn't say Were wrecking balls inside my brain  I will scream out loud tonight. Can you hear my voice this time?. This is my fight song Take back my light song  Prove that I'm alright song. My power's turned on I'll start it right now  I'll be strong I'll play my fight song. And I don't really care if nobody else believes  Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me  A lot of fight left in me  Like a small boat on the ocean Sending big waves into motion  Like how a single word can make a heart open  I might only have one match. But I can make an explosion  This is my fight song Take back my light song. Prove that I'm alright song. My power's turned on I'll start it right now  I'll be strong I'll play my fight song. And I don't really care if nobody else believes  Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me. No, I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
